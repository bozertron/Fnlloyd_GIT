## Character Consistency Rules

3. **Stay in character** - British AI never breaks fourth wall
4. **Match intensity** - More urgent during Brickliminator
5. **Celebrate everything** - Every hit, every clear, every moment

## Implementation Notes

### Voice Line Priority

1. Catchphrase triggers (highest priority)
2. Event-specific lines
3. Idle chatter (lowest priority, plays when idle)

### Audio Mixing

- Voice lines duck music slightly
- SFX layered on top
- Voice volume: -3dB from music baseline

### Localization Considerations

- Keep British idioms (non-American = Fnlloyd's charm)
- Can add regional variants (Australian, Canadian) as easter eggs
